This is Lovean's Escape, this first in hopefully a few short games I want to put on here as personal projects. It's not done yet, but I wanted to put it on here so far. 
The protagonist is the oc of a friend of mine, used with permission. 

Update 9/20/2024: I have plans to continue working on this, either on this program or just remake it from scratch as there are some issues with the gitignore and file structure I'd like to sort out when I get a better feel for this stuff. On top of that I intend to add simple visuals and resets in the future, as well as a few more endings.
